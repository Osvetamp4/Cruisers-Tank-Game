This is a github reposititory for a tank cruiser game I made in the summer of 2023. I was recently getting into game development at the time and had finished building a previous game: Circle Adventures from a tutorial.

For this game I wanted to set up a maintainable and modular system to allow me as the developer to add and develop more weapons and addons with ease. 

I wanted a module based system that could be expanded upon indefinetely which could be used interchangably with enemies and the player.

As this was my first attempt at such a system it didn't go exactly according to plan. I had succeeded in building an interchangable system, however I made my code rather unorganized and not sticking to conventions and rulings
that I have established, leading to increasingly higher times it took to add the next new weapon or addon to the player's arsenal.

This is a demo playthrough of the game, showcasing the different weapons that the player has at their disposal as well as the different types of enemies and the level layouts.
